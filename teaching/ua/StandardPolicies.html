The key sentence is this:  &#147;Integrity is expected of every student in all academic work.  The guiding principle of academic integrity is that a student's submitted work must be the student's own.&#148;  Violations of this principle will be dealt as harshly as University policy permits.</li>   <LI><B>Attendance:</B> Students are expected to attend every       scheduled class, and to be familiar with the University class       attendance policy as it appears in the General Catalog.  It is       the student's responsibility to keep informed of any       announcements, syllabus adjustments or policy changes made       during scheduled classes.  Students who are excessively        absent may be "administratively dropped" from the course. "Excessively"       means 2 days in a row or any 3 days during the semester.   <li><b>Homework:</b> Homework is an essential      component of the course and will be assigned and collected      regularly, approximately weekly.        For full credit, homework must be turned in at the beginning of      class on the day       it is due.  Late homework will be accepted for grading until the      beginning of the next class meeting, but will earn only 70%      credit.  Homework turned in later <i>may</i> be graded but will earn no      points.  The single lowest homework score will be thrown out before      calculating the final homework score.  <LI><B>Exams:</B> Exam dates will be announced at the beginning of the semester.  Exams cannot be given at any other time.      If a test is missed for a valid reason, the score for      that test will be replaced with the score on the corresponding      part of the final exam.  (The meanings of "valid" and      "corresponding part" will be determined by the instructor.) A      second missed test or project, or a missed final exam, will      result in a score of 0.  There will be no exceptions to this      policy.   <li><b>Grades:</b> Course grades will be determined by scores on   exams, projects, class participation, and homework, with weights announced at the beginning of the semester.  Grades will be   based on the percentage of possible       points earned, and will be no lower than these: 90-100%: A,       80%-90%: B, 70%-80%: C, 60%-70%: D, below 60%: E.   <li><b>W's and I's:</b> Students withdrawing from the course before       the drop date will receive the grade W if they are passing at the       time.  Students will be considered to be passing at the time of       withdraw if they have scored at least 50% on the work completed       at that time.<br>       The grade of I will be awarded only if <u>all</u> of these       conditions are met:       <ol>	 <li>The student has completed all but a small portion of the             required work. 	 <li>The student has scored at least 50% on the work completed.	 <li>The student has a valid reason for not completing the course	     on time.	 <li>The student agrees to make up the material in a short period             of time.	 <li>The student asks for the incomplete before              the final exam.       </ol></UL></body></html>

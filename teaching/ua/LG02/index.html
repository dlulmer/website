<H3>Course description and requirements:</H3>
<UL>
  <LI> Lie groups, Lie algebras, and their representations are central
      objects in modern mathematics.  For example, the symmetry groups
      of many natural geometric objects are Lie groups.  Beyond the
      obvious connections to geometry, Lie theory has had profound
      applications to analysis, number theory, particle physics, and
      other fields.  The aim of this course is to introduce students
      to main examples and structure theory of Lie groups and Lie
      algebras, as well as the basics of their finite dimensional
      linear representations. 
  <LI> Prerequisites: Math 511 and Math 534 or instructor's
      permission.
  <LI> Text (required): V. S. Varadarajan, &#147;Lie Groups, Lie
      Algebras, and Their Representations.&#148;

  <LI> Course work: Problems will be assigned in class and collected
      roughly once per week.  If needed, there will be one mid-term
      exam.  Either there will be a final exam or each student will
      complete  a project consisting of an
      expository paper and a lecture on a topic decided in
      consultation with the instructor.  (Which alternative obtains
      will be determined during the semester by the instructor, in
      consultation with class members.)
  <LI> Grades will be based 1/2 on homework and the midterm and 1/2 on
the final project or exam.
  <LI>For information on administrative drops, policies on grades of W
      or I, etc., see the instructor.

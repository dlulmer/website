<H1 align=center>Syllabus for Math 6121<br>
Algebra I<br>
Fall 2011
</h1>

<p>This is a graduate-level course in abstract algebra.  The principal aim is to lead students to a mastery of the parts of algebra that every mathematician should know.  Successfully attaining that goal will prepare students for the comprehensive exam in algebra required for the PhD program in Mathematics.</p>

<h2>Resources:</h2>
<UL>
	<LI>Text:  &ldquo;Abstract Algebra&rdquo; (third edition) by Dummit and Foote</LI>
	<LI>Alternates: The &ldquo;Algebra&rdquo; texts of Lang, Rotman, Jacobson, and Knapp are also recommended</LI>
	<LI>TA/grader: TBA</LI>
</UL>



<h2>Requirements and grades:</h2>
<ul>
	<LI>Homework will be assigned regularly, collected, and graded.</LI>
	<LI>There will be two <b>in-class exams: on Friday, September 30 and Friday, November 7</b>.  (Dates subject to change)</LI>
	<LI>The <b>final exam will Monday, December 12, 11:30 - 2:20, in Skiles 169.</b>  The in-class final may be replaced with a (harder, more interesting) take-home final if students' performance on the previous exams is sufficiently strong.</LI>
	<LI>Grades will be based on the percentage of possible points earned.  The-in class exams will each count for 20% of the grade, the final will count for 30%, and homework will count for 30%.</LI>
	<LI>Cutoff percentages for A, B, C, D are 90%, 80%, 70%, and 60% respectively.</LI>
</ul>



<h2>Other important policies and tips:</h2>
  <ul>
  	<LI>There will be <b>no make-up exams</b>.  If an in-class exam is missed for an <i>acceptable and documented</i> reason (severe illness, death in the famiy, etc.), the score on that exam will be replaced with the score on the corresponding part of the final exam.  A test missed for unacceptable or undocumented reasons will receive a score of 0.  Arrangements for extensive absences (e.g., for extracurricular activities) must be made by the end of the first week of classes.</LI>
  	<LI><b>Collaboration and plagiarism</b>:  Discussing ideas and homework exercises with your peers is not only acceptable, it is a good idea.  However, you must write your own solutions and proofs in your own words.  Copying another's words or otherwise passing off someone else's work as your own is plagiarism and will result in a score of 0 on the entire assigmemnt in question.  Egregious cases will be dealt with more harshly.  <b>ASK</b> if you have <b>any questions whatsoever about this</b></LI>
  	<LI>Homework is due at the beginning of class, usually on Mondays.  Late homework is strongly discouraged.  It will be accepted up to 48 hours after the due time and will be assessed a 20% penalty.</LI>
	<LI>The <A HREF="http://www.catalog.gatech.edu/rules/18b.php">Georgia Tech Honor Code</A> applies 100% without exception.  Know it and live it.</LI>
	<li>Experience shows that attendance in class is very much to the student's benefit.  It is strongly encouraged and offers the opportunity to earn quiz points.</li>
	<LI>Class time will be used to discuss difficult ideas, points of confusion, etc., not to go over basics in the text.  Read assignments before class and come prepared with questions.</LI>
  </ul>

<P>
First, you will learn the fundamental concepts and theorems of
differential and integral calculus of functions
from <b>R</b><sup>n</sup> to <b>R</b><sup>m</sup>.  Second, you will
apply these ideas to optimization and see some spectacular results
from classical physics, such as Kepler's laws and Guass's theorem.
Third, you will learn be introduced to differential forms and
manifolds, the natural context for many problems in geometry and
mechanics.  At the end of the day, you will master powerful tools with
a very broad range of applicability.
</P>

<P>
This course will also give you an introduction to abstraction and
higher mathematics.  We will be careful about definitions and will
give careful arguments, i.e., proofs, justifying everything we do.
You will increase your ability to write clear and precise explanations
of mathematical facts.

First, because it is really useful.  Mathematicians sometimes say that
all of mathematics is calculus and linear algebra.  This isn't
completely true, but it's close.  Multivariable calculus will be used 
(heavily) in many of your later courses and in many of your careers.
</P>

<P>
Second, you are a top student in Math, and this course is designed to
challenge students like you.
</P>

<P>
Third and most importantly, because it is really interesting!  You
will see some of the deepest and most productive ideas produced by human 
culture.

<P>
Yes!  This course is designed for students who have mastered basic
linear algebra, as demonstrated for example by doing well in Math 1554
(earning an A) or 1564 (earning an A or B).

<P>
The TAs and I are commited to helping you learn this material and
succeed in the course.  Keep at it and you will do well.

<div class="panel-body">
<P>This is a challenging course in multivariable calculus for
mathematically ambitious and well-prepared students.  You will learn
the fundamental algorithms and computational recipes as well as the
theoretical underpinnings necessary for more advanced mathematics.
Enrollment in the course is by invitation only and typically requires
a grade of A in Math 1554 or an A or B in Math 1564.  Success in this
course will prepare you for other 2000-level courses in such as
differential equations, discrete mathematics, and foundations of
mathematical proof.</P>

<div class="panel-body">
<OL>
<LI>Multivariable functions: You will understand continuity and limits
in the context of higher dimensions, and understand the relevance of
scalar- and vector-valued functions to problems in science and
engineering.</LI>
<LI>Derivatives and optimization: You will understand the derivative
of a function as a linear transformation and as the best linear
approximation to a function near a point.  You will learn to apply the
derivative to optimization problems.</LI>
<LI>Integrals: You will learn how to define and interpret
multidimensional integrals, as well as how to compute them directly
and via iterated integrals and Fubini's theorem.  You will learn
applications of integration to problems in mechanics, gravitataion,
and electrostatics.</LI>
<LI>Differential forms and manifolds: You will get an introduction to
manifolds (spaces which locally look like <b>R</b><sup>n</sup>) and
differential forms (things that can be integrated over manifolds).
These objects are used to state the general Stokes theorem, which is a
vast generalization of the fundamental theorem of calculus.</LI>
<LI>Theory and calculation: In all of the above, you will learn both
algorithms (how to compute things) and theory (careful definitions and
complete, correct arguments).  Your understanding of the theory of
calculus, both single-variable and multivariable, will increase.</LI>

	<LI>Course topics and timing:  See the <a href="syllabus.html">syllabus</a> for a detailed list of topics.</LI>
	<LI>Required text: &ldquo;Multivariable Mathematics&rdquo; by T. Shifrin.  (First edition, 2005, Wiley, ISBN: 0-471-52638-X).</LI>
	<LI>In-class polling system:  You will need to set up an account with <A HREF="https://learningcatalytics.com" TARGET="_blank">Learning Catalytics</A>.  (You may already have one if you use a Pearson book in another class.  If not, the cost is $12 for six months or $20 for a year.)  You will use this system and your laptop, tablet, or phone to answer questions in class.</LI>
	<LI>All homework assignments, lecture notes, sample exams, etc. will be posted on <A HREF="https://t-square.gatech.edu/" TARGET="_blank">t-square</A>.</LI>
	<LI>Part of each homework assignment will use the WebWork on-line homework system.  This system generates problems with randomized data, allows unlimited attempts, and grades instantly.  These problems are mostly routine drill, but are essential for mastering course material.  Assignments will be linked from t-square.  <strong>Important:</strong> To use WebWork from off-campus, you will need to use a VPN.  See <A HREF="http://oit.gatech.edu/service/vpn/vpn-service-remote-access" TARGET="_blank">this OIT page</A> for more on how to set it up.  On campus or off, you will also need to configure your browser to allow pop-ups.</LI>
	<LI>The t-square page also links to a Piazza discussion forum.  This is the place to post questions and answer questions from your fellow students.  It will be the <strong>fastest</strong> way to get your questions answered.  Active participation in Piazza will help you learn the material and will be viewed favorably when grades are assigned.</LI>

	<LI><b>Read</b> the book.  The high school technique of flipping through the section looking for an example like the problem will not work in college.  The key is to read <b>actively</b>.  This means constantly asking yourself questions like &ldquo;What is the point of this example?  What idea does it illustrate?&rdquo;  In a theorem, &ldquo;why are these assumptions being made?  What happens if we relax one of them?&rdquo;  </LI>
	<LI>It is <i>very</i> beneficial to read the relevant parts of the text <b>before class</b>.  The discussion will be much more meaningful if you already know what the key issues are.</LI>
	<LI>Your goal should be <b>active understanding</b>.  This means being able to apply concepts in a new setting.  The best way to develop active understanding is to do lots of problems.  The texts have far more good problems than can be graded in this class.  Doing them is an excellent way to study.</LI>
	<LI><b>On writing</b>:  The solution to an exercise or the proof of a theorem is a form of communication---it's a conversation between the reader and the author.  The goal is to convince the reader that the solution or proof is correct.  Doing this well involves all the same skills as writing an essay, in particular, knowing something about the audience (What can be assumed?  What is &ldquo;trivial&rdquo; and what requires explanation?)  and structuring the discussion so that it is easy to follow.  Learning to write mathematics well is an important goal for this course.</LI>
	<LI>Good solutions and proofs usually involve more words than formulas.  The author should <b>explain</b> what he or she is doing.  I'll give some examples in class.</LI>
	<LI>Working in small groups is a great idea.  If you can explain the ideas in this course to your friends, then you really know them.</LI>  
	<LI>The TAs and I are <i>resources</i>.  We can't learn the material for you, but we can help a lot, by explaining the concepts and clarifying subtle or tricky points.  Take advantage, after all, we're why you are going to Tech, not that other, lesser place down the road.</LI>
	<LI><b>Ask questions</b>, in class and in office hours.  This is how we know what you need help with, and helping you is what we are trying to do.</LI>
	<LI>The pace will be very fast and if you fall behind it will be very difficult to catch up.  <b>Keep up!</b></LI>

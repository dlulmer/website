<P>
First, you will learn the fundamental algorithm for solving systems of
linear equations, which is called &ldquo;Gauss-Jordan elimination&rdquo; or
&ldquo;row-reduction&rdquo;.  Most calculations in the subject boil down to this
algorithm.  Second, you will learn an abstract framework (&ldquo;vector
spaces and linear maps&rdquo;) that captures the essential
features of systems of equations.  This framework is sufficiently
general to model many other situations in mathematics.  Third, you
will learn a method (&ldquo;bases and coordinates&rdquo;) for translating any
question in the abstract setting into a concrete question about
systems of linear equations that can be answered with row reduction.
Along the way, we will discuss a number of applications of these ideas
to problems in science and engineering.  At the end of the day, you
will master powerful tools with a very broad range of applicability.
</P>

<P>
This course will also give you an introduction to abstraction and
higher mathematics.  We will be careful about definitions and will
give careful arguments, i.e., proofs, justifying everything we do.
You will increase your ability to write clear and precise explanations
of mathematical facts.

<P>
First, because it is really useful.  Mathematicians sometimes say that
all of mathematics is calculus and linear algebra.  This isn't
completely true, but it's close.  In science and engineering, linear
algebra is a tool used every day, for example: linear approximations
of functions (think interpolation and extrapolation), interpreting
data (least squares regressions and lines of best fit), signal
processing, computer graphics, internet search, random processes, even
the foundations of quantum mechanics.
</P>

<P>
Second, you are a top student in Math, and this course is designed to
challenge students like you.
</P>

<P>
Third and most importantly, because it is really interesting!  You
will see the power of the axiomatic method in isolating and analyzing
what is essential.

<P>
Yes!  You did well in calculus, proving that you know
how to work hard and master complex material.  Although the material
in this class is at times somewhat abstract, the underlying ideas are
pretty simple (a lot simpler than things like continuity and limits).

The TAs and I are commited to helping you learn this material and
succeed in the course.  Keep at it and you will do well.

<P>This is a first course in linear algebra for mathematically ambitious and well-prepared students.  You will learn the fundamental algorithms and computational recipes as well as the theoretical underpinnings necessary for more advanced mathematics.  Enrollment in the course is by invitation only and typically requires a score of 5 on the BC Calculus AP exam or a grade of A in Math 1552.  Success in this course will prepare you for 2000-level courses in multivariable calculus, differential equations, discrete mathematics, and foundations of mathematical proof.</P>

<LI>Basic algorithms:  You will learn to perform Gauss and Gauss-Jordan elimination (&ldquo;row reduction&rdquo;) on a matrix and interpret the results in terms of solutions of systems of linear equations, including existence, uniqueness, and parameteriztion of solutions.  You will also learn to compute least-squares approximations and identify when they are appropriate and relevant.  You will also learn to compute and interpret determinants, eigenvalues, and eigenvectors.</LI>
<LI>Abstract structures:  You will understand and apply the basic abstract structures of linear algebra, namely vector spaces, subspaces, spans and spanning sets, linear independence, and bases, as well as linear maps.</LI>
<LI>Coordinates: You will earn how a choice of basis transforms any question in the abstract setting into a concrete question about matrices and vectors which can be solved using the basic algorithms.  You will be able to interpret the results of these calculations in the abstract setting.</LI>
<LI>Applications:  You will become familiar with several applications of basic linear algebra and implementation issues:  numerical stability, analysis of DC circuits, Markov chains, the method of powers, and the Google Page Rank algorithm.</LI>

	<LI>Required text: &ldquo;Linear Algebra&rdquo; by J. Hefferon.  Available as a free download at <A HREF="http://joshua.smcvt.edu/linearalgebra/" TARGET="_blank">http://joshua.smcvt.edu/linearalgebra/</A>.  A printed and bound version is available from <A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/Linear-Algebra-Jim-Hefferon/dp/0989897567/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1433522104&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=hefferon+linear+algebra" TARGET="_blank">Amazon</A>.</LI>
	<LI>In-class polling system:  You will need to set up an account with <A HREF="https://learningcatalytics.com" TARGET="_blank">Learning Catalytics</A>.  (You may already have one if you use a Pearson book in another class.  If not, the cost is $12 for six months or $20 for a year.)  You will use this system and your laptop, tablet, or phone to answer questions in class.</LI>
	<LI>All homework assignments, lecture notes, sample exams, etc. will be posted on <A HREF="https://t-square.gatech.edu/" TARGET="_blank">t-square</A>.</LI>
	<LI>Part of each homework assignment will use the WebWork on-line homework system.  This system generates problems with randomized data, allows unlimited attempts, and grades instantly.  These problems are mostly routine drill, but are essential for mastering course material.  Assignments will be linked from t-square.  <strong>Important:</strong> To use WebWork from off-campus, you will need to use a VPN.  See <A HREF="http://oit.gatech.edu/service/vpn/vpn-service-remote-access" TARGET="_blank">this OIT page</A> for more on how to set it up.  On campus or off, you will also need to configure your browser to allow pop-ups.</LI>
	<LI>The t-square page also links to a Piazza discussion forum.  This is the place to post questions and answer questions from your fellow students.  It will be the <strong>fastest</strong> way to get your questions answered.  Active participation in Piazza will help you learn the material and will be viewed favorably when grades are assigned.</LI>

	<LI><b>Read</b> the book.  The high school technique of flipping through the section looking for an example like the problem will not work in college.  The key is to read <b>actively</b>.  This means constantly asking yourself questions like &ldquo;What is the point of this example?  What idea does it illustrate?&rdquo;  In a theorem, &ldquo;why are these assumptions being made?  What happens if we relax one of them?&rdquo;  </LI>
	<LI>It is <i>very</i> beneficial to read the relevant parts of the text <b>before class</b>.  The discussion will be much more meaningful if you already know what the key issues are.</LI>
	<LI>Your goal should be <b>active understanding</b>.  This means being able to apply concepts in a new setting.  The best way to develop active understanding is to do lots of problems.  The texts have far more good problems than can be graded in this class.  Doing them is an excellent way to study.</LI>
	<LI><b>On writing</b>:  The solution to an exercise or the proof of a theorem is a form of communication---it's a conversation between the reader and the author.  The goal is to convince the reader that the solution or proof is correct.  Doing this well involves all the same skills as writing an essay, in particular, knowing something about the audience (What can be assumed?  What is &ldquo;trivial&rdquo; and what requires explanation?)  and structuring the discussion so that it is easy to follow.  Learning to write mathematics well is an important goal for this course.</LI>
	<LI>Good solutions and proofs usually involve more words than formulas.  The author should <b>explain</b> what he or she is doing.  I'll give some examples in class.</LI>
	<LI>Working in small groups is a great idea.  If you can explain the ideas in this course to your friends, then you really know them.</LI>  
	<LI>The TAs and I are <i>resources</i>.  We can't learn the material for you, but we can help a lot, by explaining the concepts and clarifying subtle or tricky points.  Take advantage, after all, we're why you are going to Tech, not that other, lesser place down the road.</LI>
	<LI><b>Ask questions</b>, in class and in office hours.  This is how we know what you need help with, and helping you is what we are trying to do.</LI>

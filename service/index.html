<li>I am on the editorial board of the <a href="http://jtnb.math.u-bordeaux1.fr" target="_blank"><i>Journal de Th&eacute;orie des Nombres de Bordeaux</i></a>, an international journal focused on number theory and related fields.  Please send strong papers!</li>
<li>I serve as the Treasurer of the <a href="https://www.ams.org/home/page" target="_blank">American Mathematical Society</a>

<H2>Projects</H2>
<ul>
	<li>Here are a few projects completed at Georgia Tech that go beyond the day-to-day duties of chairing a large department:
		<ul>
		<li>The School of Mathematics revamped of our lower-division courses, the mathematical core of most majors on campus.  The reforms were rolled out in Fall 2015.</li>
		<li>Implementing a major post-doctoral program has been a School priority for many years.  Although there is still much to do, we have made a good start with 16 post-docs in residence during the 2013-14 and 2014-15 academic years.  We also received a 5-year NSF MCTP grant of $1.3M to support post-docs.</li>
		<li>We are proud of the School's annual newsletter <a href="http://www.math.gatech.edu/proofreader" target="_blank"><i>ProofReader</i></a>.</li>
		<li>The School's graduate program won major NSF support in 2011 via an S-STEM award.</li>
		<li>We're making a serious effort to reach out to alumni, in particular, by forming an <i>Friends of the School of Mathematics</i> (FoSoM) group.  We organize roughly one activity per semester with FoSoM.</li>
		<li>We developed a partnership with <a href="http://global.jlu.edu.cn/User/Index/index" target="_blank">Jilin University</a> in northeastern China which includes a joint research center and student exchanges.</li>
		<li>In 2010, the School took over new space in Skiles, including two comfortable new seminar rooms and a suite of 10 office on the ground floor.  Several other sizable faculty offices were created from classroom space and smaller offices.</li>
		<li>In 2009-10, the School developed a 5-year strategic hiring plan.  The plan was revisited and reaffirmed in 2012.</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>And here are a few projects from my previous life at the University of Arizona:
		<UL>
			<LI>The <a href="http://math.arizona.edu/vigre/" target="_blank">VIGRE program at the University of Arizona</a></LI>
			<LI>The <a href="http://swc.math.arizona.edu" target="_blank">Southwestern Center for Arithmetical Algebraic Geometry</a></LI>
			<li>The <a href="http://math.arizona.edu/gradprogram/workshops/integration/" target="_blank">Integration Workshop</a> at the University of Arizona</li>
		</UL></li>	
</ul>
